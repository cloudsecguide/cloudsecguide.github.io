CloudSecGuide's mission is to make securing cloud environments easier in the cloud-agnostic age.

Applications designed to be cloud-agnostic are built in a way to easily deploy to multiple cloud providers. This has made it
increasingly difficult to secure these resources, while avoiding vendor lock-in and providing consistent security control
behavior.

CloudSecGuide compares and constrasts the different ways the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) implement various cloud
concepts, especially as those concepts relate to security. In addition, examples of cloud-agnostic security controls are
provided.
